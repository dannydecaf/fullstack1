Developed initial stages of 'PlaceMark' application, which will evolve and progress over time and into assignment 2.

Incorporated Signup / Login features, with Cookie/Auth User Settings on app.
Implemented Name, Description, Lat and Lng parameters into POIs, and grouped them into categories (counties of Ireland).
Incorporated Basic API structure into application.
Initially, relied on Memory-based models, before evolving to JSON based models.

Fully intend to implement some missing features (good, outstanding, excellent) into Assignment V2 for a more powerful application.
