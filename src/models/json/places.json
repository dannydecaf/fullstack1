The O’ Reilly family owned the lands up until the end of the 16th century when they were acquired by Thomas Fleming who built Flemings Castle . The ruins of the castle can still be seen in the park. The estate was acquired by the Pratt family and they built the town of Kingscourt in the years 1760-1770.The lands were acquired by the Irish Forest Service in 1959 and were developed into a forest park in the early 1970s..  There is a great diversity of wildlife in the park.  The flora is varied and in many areas spectacular. The tree storey is dominated by oak and ash but includes many other species often with an under storey of hazel, holly and rhododendron. The ground is, in season, carpeted with a rich layer of plants including snowdrops, bluebells, wood anemone, woodrush, foxgloves, wood sorrel and a wide range of ferns.

In 1987 the area was declared a statutory nature reserve. The islands, for the most part, are covered by the waters of the Lee Hydro-electrical scheme. However, during dry periods numerous rare species of plants can be encountered e.g. mud worth, which is only found in one other location outside the Gearagh.  This area is also of interest to bird watchers with both summer and winter migrants. From October onwards migratory birds arrive in large flocks.

The garden is a mixture of informal and formal design with terraces, fountains, ornamental gates and flower borders. To walk around the forest park's mile-long lake, encountering some intriguing modern sculptures on the way, is to enjoy a great experience of eighteenth-century landscaping.  The planting of the walled Annesley garden, the focus of the arboretum, was begun in the 1850s and rare conifers and maples were later imported directly from Japan. Then came the addition of more rich varieties, including Chilean eucryphias, Australian athrotaxis and pittosporum and Chinese rhododendrons. The arboretum holds many trees with record heights in the British Isles.  One of Northern Ireland's most famous lakes, a stunning Victorian Castle, incredible panoramic views, scenic walking trails, 27km of Mountain Bike Trails, Nature Play perfect for the kids, an onsite multi-activity centre, hedge maze and equestrian centre, Castlewellan Forest Park boasts all of this and more making it a must-visit for all ages.",

The park has since been substantially expanded and encompasses over 102.89 km2 (25,425 acres) of diverse ecology, including the Lakes of Killarney, Oak and Yew woodlands of international importance, and mountain peaks. It has Ireland's only native herd of Red Deer and the most extensive covering of native forest remaining in Ireland. The park is of high ecological value because of the quality, diversity, and extensiveness of many of its habitats and the wide variety of species that they accommodate, some of which are rare. The park was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1981. The park forms part of a Special Area of Conservation.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service is responsible for the management and administration of the park.

The estate was later acquired by Sir Edward Harland of Harland & Wolfe Shipyard in Belfast who used it as a hunting lodge. He died there on 24th December 1895 and his remains were taken from the railway station in Glenfarne to Belfast where the cortege was met by thousands of shipyard workers. It is said that the flagstones that line the quay in the shipyard where the Titanic was built came from quarries on the Glenfarne Estate.  Today looped trails, of varying lengths, have been sensitively established and offer panoramic views of Northern Ireland on the other side of the lake. The trails take you from the car park along the edge of Lough MacNean, returning through a diverse and varied forest.

It is home to the native Irish red squirrel and to Sika deer. These can be sighted walking or biking the numerous way-marked trails of various lengths threading through the forest.

The river supports a wide range of waterfowl, such as herons, water hens, swans and ducks. The Forest is partially bordered by what is known locally as ‘the Famine Wall’, which stretches halfway along the road from Cootehill to Rockcorry.   Dartrey Forest was formerly part of the Dartrey Estate of the Dawson family who had the title of ‘Earl of Dartrey’ from 1866 to 1933.
